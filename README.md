# Cybersecurity-Project


Our CRUD project wa originally meant to be done in java, however there was too much going wrong so we decided
to resort to using dart. It uses the flutter framework and as a database we're using firestore.
To set up firestore use this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U45mIlvbi6s

Also, we apologize for the lack of audio in the video, Rudy recorded and doesn't have a mic,
but with time running out we decided it would be better to get everything working on just one of
our systems and test everything there. The instructions in our google doc should follow what's in 
the recording.

The application was used on vscode. 
Uses dart language.
An android emulator is needed. (We used Android Studio)
